# job-board
Description: Build a job board platform where companies can post job listings, and job seekers can browse and apply for jobs. Job listings should include detailed information, and users should be able to apply directly through the platform.

Requirements:

GitHub Repository: Each student should have a dedicated branch within a shared GitHub repository.
Authentication: Implement basic user authentication for both companies and job seekers.
Input Validation: Ensure proper input validation for job listings and job applications.
Technologies Stack: Use React for the frontend with one of the specified UI libraries. For the backend, use Node.js along with either MySQL or MongoDB.
React Router: Utilize React Router for smooth navigation within the job board.
Database (if using MySQL): Use Sequelize as an ORM for interacting with the MySQL database.
In each project, it's important to prioritize user experience, data integrity, and security. These improved descriptions and requirements provide a more detailed framework for students to follow during the sprint.
